10) DENCODE
Denominational affiliation, collapsed. Remarks: DENCODE combines the information from DENOM1 and TRAD to create an aggregated religious family variable. Note that DENCODE places congregations in a category if the religious tradition of the congregation was clear, even if HAVEDEN=2. This coding mainly affected independent Baptist congregations, which are assigned to a Baptist category on DENCODE even if they reported no formal affiliation on HAVEDEN.

12) TRAD
What is your congregation's religion or religious group? Remarks: TRAD codes each congregation's religious tradition, without respect to formal affiliation with a denomination. For most congregations, TRAD=DENOM1. However, for congregations that did not report affiliation with a denomination, we sometimes were able to use this item or other information (for example, the congregation's name) to identify the congregation's religious tradition. TRAD, therefore, may assign a congregation to a tradition even if HAVEDEN=2.

13) TRAD3
Religious tradition, collapsed. Remarks: TRAD3 uses all available information to place congregations into very broad religious traditions. 'Black Protestant' (TRAD3=3) means that a congregation is affiliated with one of the seven major denominations that are predominately African American or that the congregation's membership is at least 80% African American (BLACKPCT=80 or higher). As broad religious traditions, 'White conservative, evangelical, or fundamentalist' (TRAD3=2) and 'White liberal or moderate' (TRAD3=4) do not specify racial composition and may include congregations without a racial majority 'White'.

14) LOCALAFF
Is your congregation affiliated with any local association of congregations such as a local council of churches? Remarks: In 1998, the skip instruction attached to HAVEDEN was incorrect. When HAVEDEN=2, informants should have been asked LOCALAFF, but instead interviewers were directed to BLDGTYPE. Because of this error, LOCALAFF was asked only of congregations who reported an affiliation with a denomination. LOCALAFF therefore should be used with caution and interpreted appropriately.

Therefore, any changes in FTSTAFF between 1998 and other years should be interpreted with caution.

[1998] Most recent or main worship service [2006-07 and 2012] Most recent or main worship service at which respondent was present. Day of the month (1 through 31). Remarks: These variables were constructed using a series of items designed to identify the focal service for LENGTH-SOCLTIME. This series of items is identical, except that in 2006-07 and 2012 we asked the respondent whether s/he was present for the most recent service; if not, s/he was asked about the most recent service at which s/he was present. The focal service for subsequent questions is then always the most recent one attended (and thus may have occurred earlier than the past week). Respondents in congregations with zero (0) services in the past week were asked to think about the most recent worship service. Respondents in congregations with only one (1) service in the past week were asked to think about that service (or the most recent one attended, if not in the past week). Respondents in congregations with multiple services (greater than or equal to 2) in the past week were asked to identify and think about the 'main' service in the past week (or the most recent 'main' service attended, if not in the past week).

264) HJUMP
Did adults jump, shout, or dance spontaneously during this service? Remarks: These variables were constructed using a series of items designed to identify the focal Hispanic service for items HAMEN-HRAISHND. We asked the respondent whether s/he was present for the focal service; if not, s/he was asked about the most recent service at which s/he was present. The focal service for subsequent questions is then always the most recent one attended (and thus may have occurred earlier than the past week). See also remarks for ATSPSVC. Respondents in congregations with zero (0) Hispanic services in the past week were asked to think about the most recent worship service. Respondents in congregations with only one (1) Hispanic service in the past week were asked to think about that service. Respondents in congregations with multiple Hispanic worship services (greater than or equal to 2) in the past week were asked to identify and think about the 'main' Hispanic service in the past week. If there was more than one Hispanic worship service in the past week, this item refers to the main Hispanic worship service for the congregation.

328) GACTN98
[1998 wording] For what purpose or purposes do these groups meet [have these groups met]? Social justice, neighborhood, or community issues. Remarks: Verbatim responses were coded into a series of dichotomous variables, each of which indicates whether a congregation mentioned a group of a particular type in response to these items. There are major differences in how group information was gathered in 1998 and 2006-07. In 1998, group information was gathered with multiple items designed to elicit information on groups that met monthly or more often (GRPX) versus those that met less frequently (GRPY). These details about group purpose of the top five (5) groups for each of GRPX and GRPY were collected before asking questions about specific group types in POLITICS-MILLNESS. In 2006-07, however, this verbatim group information about the top three (3) groups follows and therefore excludes specifically mentioned groups in POLITICS-MILLNESS. As a result, many fewer groups were mentioned in 2006-07 than in 1998. Because of this major difference, we created two versions of each dichotomous variable. Variables with the suffix '98' contain codes for groups mentioned in 1998. Variables with the suffix '06' contain codes for groups mentioned in 2006-07 (OTHGRPS). Note that variables in this series are not mutually exclusive. A 1998 group for women that meets for Bible study, for example, is coded 1 on both GBIBLE98 and GFEM98. Note also that these variables are coded at the congregation level, not at the group level. This means that, if a congregation is coded 1 on several of these variables, analysts will not be able to determine whether those codes refer to one group or to more than one group. Verbatim group descriptions may be requested via a restricted-data access agreement. If a congregation reported no groups (GRPX=2 and GRPY=2 in 1998; OTHGRPS=2 in 2006-07), these variables were set at zero.

In 1998, group information was gathered with multiple items designed to elicit information on groups that met monthly or more often (GRPX) versus those that met less frequently (GRPY). These details about group purpose of the top five (5) groups for each of GRPX and GRPY were collected before asking questions about specific group types in POLITICS-MILLNESS. In 2006-07, however, this verbatim group information about the top three (3) groups follows and therefore excludes specifically mentioned groups in POLITICS-MILLNESS. As a result, many fewer groups were mentioned in 2006-07 than in 1998. Because of this major difference, we created two versions of each dichotomous variable. Variables with the suffix '98' contain codes for groups mentioned in 1998. Variables with the suffix '06' contain codes for groups mentioned in 2006-07 (OTHGRPS). Note that variables in this series are not mutually exclusive. A 1998 group for women that meets for Bible study, for example, is coded 1 on both GBIBLE98 and GFEM98. Note also that these variables are coded at the congregation level, not at the group level. This means that, if a congregation is coded 1 on several of these variables, analysts will not be able to determine whether those codes refer to one group or to more than one group. Verbatim group descriptions may be requested via a restricted-data access agreement. If a congregation reported no groups (GRPX=2 and GRPY=2 in 1998; OTHGRPS=2 in 2006-07), these variables were set at zero.

353) GLIT98
[1998 wording] For what purpose or purposes do these groups meet [have these groups met]? Focused on congregations' worship or liturgy. Remarks: Verbatim responses were coded into a series of dichotomous variables, each of which indicates whether a congregation mentioned a group of a particular type in response to these items. There are major differences in how group information was gathered in 1998 and 2006-07. In 1998, group information was gathered with multiple items designed to elicit information on groups that met monthly or more often (GRPX) versus those that met less frequently (GRPY). These details about group purpose of the top five (5) groups for each of GRPX and GRPY were collected before asking questions about specific group types in POLITICS-MILLNESS. In 2006-07, however, this verbatim group information about the top three (3) groups follows and therefore excludes specifically mentioned groups in POLITICS-MILLNESS. As a result, many fewer groups were mentioned in 2006-07 than in 1998. Because of this major difference, we created two versions of each dichotomous variable. Variables with the suffix '98' contain codes for groups mentioned in 1998. Variables with the suffix '06' contain codes for groups mentioned in 2006-07 (OTHGRPS). Note that variables in this series are not mutually exclusive. A 1998 group for women that meets for Bible study, for example, is coded 1 on both GBIBLE98 and GFEM98. Note also that these variables are coded at the congregation level, not at the group level. This means that, if a congregation is coded 1 on several of these variables, analysts will not be able to determine whether those codes refer to one group or to more than one group. Verbatim group descriptions may be requested via a restricted-data access agreement. If a congregation reported no groups (GRPX=2 and GRPY=2 in 1998; OTHGRPS=2 in 2006-07), these variables were set at zero.

367) GSUPP98
[1998 wording] For what purpose or purposes do these groups meet [have these groups met]? Support groups for specific problems or issues, except bereavement and substance abuse. Remarks: Verbatim responses were coded into a series of dichotomous variables, each of which indicates whether a congregation mentioned a group of a particular type in response to these items. There are major differences in how group information was gathered in 1998 and 2006-07. In 1998, group information was gathered with multiple items designed to elicit information on groups that met monthly or more often (GRPX) versus those that met less frequently (GRPY). These details about group purpose of the top five (5) groups for each of GRPX and GRPY were collected before asking questions about specific group types in POLITICS-MILLNESS. In 2006-07, however, this verbatim group information about the top three (3) groups follows and therefore excludes specifically mentioned groups in POLITICS-MILLNESS. As a result, many fewer groups were mentioned in 2006-07 than in 1998. Because of this major difference, we created two versions of each dichotomous variable. Variables with the suffix '98' contain codes for groups mentioned in 1998. Variables with the suffix '06' contain codes for groups mentioned in 2006-07 (OTHGRPS). Note that variables in this series are not mutually exclusive. A 1998 group for women that meets for Bible study, for example, is coded 1 on both GBIBLE98 and GFEM98.

Remarks: Verbatim responses were coded into a series of dichotomous variables, each of which indicates whether a congregation mentioned a group of a particular type in response to these items. There are major differences in how group information was gathered in 1998 and 2006-07. In 1998, group information was gathered with multiple items designed to elicit information on groups that met monthly or more often (GRPX) versus those that met less frequently (GRPY). These details about group purpose of the top five (5) groups for each of GRPX and GRPY were collected before asking questions about specific group types in POLITICS-MILLNESS. In 2006-07, however, this verbatim group information about the top three (3) groups follows and therefore excludes specifically mentioned groups in POLITICS-MILLNESS. As a result, many fewer groups were mentioned in 2006-07 than in 1998. Because of this major difference, we created two versions of each dichotomous variable. Variables with the suffix '98' contain codes for groups mentioned in 1998. Variables with the suffix '06' contain codes for groups mentioned in 2006-07 (OTHGRPS). Note that variables in this series are not mutually exclusive. A 1998 group for women that meets for Bible study, for example, is coded 1 on both GBIBLE98 and GFEM98. Note also that these variables are coded at the congregation level, not at the group level. This means that, if a congregation is coded 1 on several of these variables, analysts will not be able to determine whether those codes refer to one group or to more than one group. Verbatim group descriptions may be requested via a restricted-data access agreement. If a congregation reported no groups (GRPX=2 and GRPY=2 in 1998; OTHGRPS=2 in 2006-07), these variables were set at zero.

[2006-07 wording] What are the three best attended groups that you haven't already mentioned? Specifically for children and youth. Remarks: Verbatim responses were coded into a series of dichotomous variables, each of which indicates whether a congregation mentioned a group of a particular type in response to these items. There are major differences in how group information was gathered in 1998 and 2006-07. In 1998, group information was gathered with multiple items designed to elicit information on groups that met monthly or more often (GRPX) versus those that met less frequently (GRPY). These details about group purpose of the top five (5) groups for each of GRPX and GRPY were collected before asking questions about specific group types in POLITICS-MILLNESS. In 2006-07, however, this verbatim group information about the top three (3) groups follows and therefore excludes specifically mentioned groups in POLITICS-MILLNESS. As a result, many fewer groups were mentioned in 2006-07 than in 1998. Because of this major difference, we created two versions of each dichotomous variable. Variables with the suffix '98' contain codes for groups mentioned in 1998. Variables with the suffix '06' contain codes for groups mentioned in 2006-07 (OTHGRPS). Note that variables in this series are not mutually exclusive. A 1998 group for women that meets for Bible study, for example, is coded 1 on both GBIBLE98 and GFEM98. Note also that these variables are coded at the congregation level, not at the group level. This means that, if a congregation is coded 1 on several of these variables, analysts will not be able to determine whether those codes refer to one group or to more than one group.

As a result, many fewer groups were mentioned in 2006-07 than in 1998. Because of this major difference, we created two versions of each dichotomous variable. Variables with the suffix '98' contain codes for groups mentioned in 1998. Variables with the suffix '06' contain codes for groups mentioned in 2006-07 (OTHGRPS). Note that variables in this series are not mutually exclusive. A 1998 group for women that meets for Bible study, for example, is coded 1 on both GBIBLE98 and GFEM98. Note also that these variables are coded at the congregation level, not at the group level. This means that, if a congregation is coded 1 on several of these variables, analysts will not be able to determine whether those codes refer to one group or to more than one group. Verbatim group descriptions may be requested via a restricted-data access agreement. If a congregation reported no groups (GRPX=2 and GRPY=2 in 1998; OTHGRPS=2 in 2006-07), these variables were set at zero.

479) SCLSERV2
Within the past 12 months, has your congregation engaged in any human service projects, outreach ministries, or other activities intended to help people who are not members of your congregation? Remarks: This item was asked in 2006-07 and 2012 only if a respondent answered 'no' to SOCLSERV (SOCLSERV=2). The items regarding project and program details (SABUSE98-GOVF2_12) were asked only if congregations reported social services. In 1998, they were asked if SOCLSERV=1; in 2006-07 and 2012, they were asked if SOCLSERV=1 or SCLSERV2=1. Therefore, even though a number of the items below are worded identically across survey waves, they were asked of different subsets of congregations. In order to assess change over time with these items, analysts need to make the later versions comparable to the 1998 versions by recoding the 2006-07 and 2012 responses to 'No' or 'zero' for cases on which SOCLSERV=2.

Note that this variable contains totals for congregations who answered 'yes' to either social service item (SOCLSERV=1 or SCLSERV2=1). Therefore, this item is not comparable to TOTPRG98; to compute a variable for 2006-07 that is comparable to TOTPRG98, analysts should set TOTPRG6A to zero when SOCLSERV=2. If a congregation does not have any social service programs (SOCLSERV=2 and SCLSERV2=2), TOTPRG6A was set at zero.

Therefore, this item is not comparable to TOTPRG98; to compute a variable for 2006-07 that is comparable to TOTPRG98, analysts should set TOTPRG6B to zero when SOCLSERV=2.

[2012 wording, if NUMPROG is greater than 4] What are the 4 most important projects or programs you have sponsored or participated in? Services for victims of rape or domestic violence. Remarks: In 1998 and 2006-07, informants were probed to describe as many programs as they could recall. In 2012, the number of projects or programs was limited to the four most important. Verbatim responses to SABUSE98-SOTHER12 were coded into a series of dichotomous variables, each of which indicates whether a congregation mentioned a program of a particular type. There are three versions of each dichotomous variable. Variables with the suffix '98' contain codes for programs mentioned in 1998, those with the suffix '06' contain codes for programs mentioned in 2006-07, and those with the suffix '12' contain codes for programs mentioned in 2012. The coding of these items is identical in all survey waves, but the questions were asked of different subsamples of congregations (see the remark on SCLSERV2). Also, a 'No' response to a program variable in 1998 and 2006-07 (e.g., SFOOD98=0) means that the congregation was not involved in such a social services program. In 2012, a 'No' response to a program variable (e.g., SFOOD12) means that such a social service program is not one of the four most important for that congregation. Appropriate recoding is necessary to assess change over time between 1998 and 2006-07 in response to these items. Care must be taken when assessing any change over time that includes 2012. Note that these variables are not mutually exclusive. A 1998 program described as 'feeding the homeless,' for example, is coded 1 on both SFOOD98 and SHOME98. Note also that these variables are coded at the congregation level, not at the program level. This means that, if a congregation is coded 1 on several of these variables, analysts will not be able to determine whether those codes refer to one program or to more than one program. Verbatim social service program descriptions may be requested via a restricted-data access agreement. This item was asked only if congregations reported social service programs (SOCLSERV=1 or SCLSERV2=1). If congregations do not have any social service programs (SOCLSERV=2 in 1998; SOCLSERV=2 and SCLSERV2=2 in 2006-07 and 2012), these variables were set at zero.

Also, a 'No' response to a program variable in 1998 and 2006-07 (e.g., SFOOD98=0) means that the congregation was not involved in such a social services program. In 2012, a 'No' response to a program variable (e.g., SFOOD12) means that such a social service program is not one of the four most important for that congregation. Appropriate recoding is necessary to assess change over time between 1998 and 2006-07 in response to these items. Care must be taken when assessing any change over time that includes 2012. Note that these variables are not mutually exclusive. A 1998 program described as 'feeding the homeless,' for example, is coded 1 on both SFOOD98 and SHOME98. Note also that these variables are coded at the congregation level, not at the program level. This means that, if a congregation is coded 1 on several of these variables, analysts will not be able to determine whether those codes refer to one program or to more than one program. Verbatim social service program descriptions may be requested via a restricted-data access agreement. This item was asked only if congregations reported social service programs (SOCLSERV=1 or SCLSERV2=1). If congregations do not have any social service programs (SOCLSERV=2 in 1998; SOCLSERV=2 and SCLSERV2=2 in 2006-07 and 2012), these variables were set at zero.

[2012 wording, if NUMPROG is greater than 4] What are the 4 most important projects or programs you have sponsored or participated in? Substance abuse programs. Remarks: In 1998 and 2006-07, informants were probed to describe as many programs as they could recall. In 2012, the number of projects or programs was limited to the four most important. Verbatim responses to SABUSE98-SOTHER12 were coded into a series of dichotomous variables, each of which indicates whether a congregation mentioned a program of a particular type. There are three versions of each dichotomous variable. Variables with the suffix '98' contain codes for programs mentioned in 1998, those with the suffix '06' contain codes for programs mentioned in 2006-07, and those with the suffix '12' contain codes for programs mentioned in 2012. The coding of these items is identical in all survey waves, but the questions were asked of different subsamples of congregations (see the remark on SCLSERV2). Also, a 'No' response to a program variable in 1998 and 2006-07 (e.g., SFOOD98=0) means that the congregation was not involved in such a social services program. In 2012, a 'No' response to a program variable (e.g., SFOOD12) means that such a social service program is not one of the four most important for that congregation. Appropriate recoding is necessary to assess change over time between 1998 and 2006-07 in response to these items. Care must be taken when assessing any change over time that includes 2012. Note that these variables are not mutually exclusive. A 1998 program described as 'feeding the homeless,' for example, is coded 1 on both SFOOD98 and SHOME98. Note also that these variables are coded at the congregation level, not at the program level. This means that, if a congregation is coded 1 on several of these variables, analysts will not be able to determine whether those codes refer to one program or to more than one program.

Remarks: In 1998 and 2006-07, informants were probed to describe as many programs as they could recall. In 2012, the number of projects or programs was limited to the four most important. Verbatim responses to SABUSE98-SOTHER12 were coded into a series of dichotomous variables, each of which indicates whether a congregation mentioned a program of a particular type. There are three versions of each dichotomous variable. Variables with the suffix '98' contain codes for programs mentioned in 1998, those with the suffix '06' contain codes for programs mentioned in 2006-07, and those with the suffix '12' contain codes for programs mentioned in 2012. The coding of these items is identical in all survey waves, but the questions were asked of different subsamples of congregations (see the remark on SCLSERV2). Also, a 'No' response to a program variable in 1998 and 2006-07 (e.g., SFOOD98=0) means that the congregation was not involved in such a social services program. In 2012, a 'No' response to a program variable (e.g., SFOOD12) means that such a social service program is not one of the four most important for that congregation. Appropriate recoding is necessary to assess change over time between 1998 and 2006-07 in response to these items. Care must be taken when assessing any change over time that includes 2012. Note that these variables are not mutually exclusive. A 1998 program described as 'feeding the homeless,' for example, is coded 1 on both SFOOD98 and SHOME98. Note also that these variables are coded at the congregation level, not at the program level. This means that, if a congregation is coded 1 on several of these variables, analysts will not be able to determine whether those codes refer to one program or to more than one program. Verbatim social service program descriptions may be requested via a restricted-data access agreement. This item was asked only if congregations reported social service programs (SOCLSERV=1 or SCLSERV2=1). If congregations do not have any social service programs (SOCLSERV=2 in 1998; SOCLSERV=2 and SCLSERV2=2 in 2006-07 and 2012), these variables were set at zero.

In 2012, a 'No' response to a program variable (e.g., SFOOD12) means that such a social service program is not one of the four most important for that congregation. Appropriate recoding is necessary to assess change over time between 1998 and 2006-07 in response to these items. Care must be taken when assessing any change over time that includes 2012. Note that these variables are not mutually exclusive. A 1998 program described as 'feeding the homeless,' for example, is coded 1 on both SFOOD98 and SHOME98. Note also that these variables are coded at the congregation level, not at the program level. This means that, if a congregation is coded 1 on several of these variables, analysts will not be able to determine whether those codes refer to one program or to more than one program. Verbatim social service program descriptions may be requested via a restricted-data access agreement. This item was asked only if congregations reported social service programs (SOCLSERV=1 or SCLSERV2=1). If congregations do not have any social service programs (SOCLSERV=2 in 1998; SOCLSERV=2 and SCLSERV2=2 in 2006-07 and 2012), these variables were set at zero.

Remarks: In 1998 and 2006-07, informants were probed to describe as many programs as they could recall. In 2012, the number of projects or programs was limited to the four most important. Verbatim responses to SABUSE98-SOTHER12 were coded into a series of dichotomous variables, each of which indicates whether a congregation mentioned a program of a particular type. There are three versions of each dichotomous variable. Variables with the suffix '98' contain codes for programs mentioned in 1998, those with the suffix '06' contain codes for programs mentioned in 2006-07, and those with the suffix '12' contain codes for programs mentioned in 2012.

What are the three most important? Programs to help people obtain jobs. Remarks: OTHPRJ and PABUSE06-PVOL06 are attempts to gather information on any additional social service programs from respondents, programs they might have neglected to mention in response to SABUSE98-SVDP06 and SABUSE12-SOTHER12. Verbatim responses to this question were coded into a series of dichotomous variables, each of which indicates whether a congregation mentioned a program of a particular type. We did not ask respondents to identify collaborators for programs mentioned here. Note that these variables are not mutually exclusive. A program described as 'feeding the homeless,' for example, is coded 1 on both PFOOD06 and PHOME06. Note also that these variables are coded at the congregation level, not at the program level. This means that, if a congregation is coded 1 on several of these variables, analysts will not be able to determine whether those codes refer to one program or to more than one program. Verbatim program descriptions may be requested via a restricted-data access agreement. If congregations did not report any additional social service programs (OTHPRJ=2), these variables were set at zero.

[2012 wording, if NUMPROG is greater than 4] What are the 4 most important projects or programs you have sponsored or participated in? Services for victims of rape or domestic violence. Remarks: In 1998 and 2006-07, informants were probed to describe as many programs as they could recall. In 2012, the number of projects or programs was limited to the four most important. Verbatim responses to SABUSE98-SOTHER12 were coded into a series of dichotomous variables, each of which indicates whether a congregation mentioned a program of a particular type. There are three versions of each dichotomous variable. Variables with the suffix '98' contain codes for programs mentioned in 1998, those with the suffix '06' contain codes for programs mentioned in 2006-07, and those with the suffix '12' contain codes for programs mentioned in 2012. The coding of these items is identical in all survey waves, but the questions were asked of different subsamples of congregations (see the remark on SCLSERV2). Also, a 'No' response to a program variable in 1998 and 2006-07 (e.g., SFOOD98=0) means that the congregation was not involved in such a social services program. In 2012, a 'No' response to a program variable (e.g., SFOOD12) means that such a social service program is not one of the four most important for that congregation. Appropriate recoding is necessary to assess change over time between 1998 and 2006-07 in response to these items. Care must be taken when assessing any change over time that includes 2012. Note that these variables are not mutually exclusive. A 1998 program described as 'feeding the homeless,' for example, is coded 1 on both SFOOD98 and SHOME98. Note also that these variables are coded at the congregation level, not at the program level. This means that, if a congregation is coded 1 on several of these variables, analysts will not be able to determine whether those codes refer to one program or to more than one program. Verbatim social service program descriptions may be requested via a restricted-data access agreement. This item was asked only if congregations reported social service programs (SOCLSERV=1 or SCLSERV2=1).

Note that these variables are not mutually exclusive. A 1998 program described as 'feeding the homeless,' for example, is coded 1 on both SFOOD98 and SHOME98. Note also that these variables are coded at the congregation level, not at the program level. This means that, if a congregation is coded 1 on several of these variables, analysts will not be able to determine whether those codes refer to one program or to more than one program. Verbatim social service program descriptions may be requested via a restricted-data access agreement.

[1998 and 2006-07 wording] What projects or programs have you sponsored or participated in? [2012 wording, if NUMPROG is less than or equal to 4] What projects or programs have you sponsored or participated in? [2012 wording, if NUMPROG is greater than 4] What are the 4 most important projects or programs you have sponsored or participated in? Specifically for children or youth. Remarks: In 1998 and 2006-07, informants were probed to describe as many programs as they could recall. In 2012, the number of projects or programs was limited to the four most important. Verbatim responses to SABUSE98-SOTHER12 were coded into a series of dichotomous variables, each of which indicates whether a congregation mentioned a program of a particular type. There are three versions of each dichotomous variable. Variables with the suffix '98' contain codes for programs mentioned in 1998, those with the suffix '06' contain codes for programs mentioned in 2006-07, and those with the suffix '12' contain codes for programs mentioned in 2012. The coding of these items is identical in all survey waves, but the questions were asked of different subsamples of congregations (see the remark on SCLSERV2). Also, a 'No' response to a program variable in 1998 and 2006-07 (e.g., SFOOD98=0) means that the congregation was not involved in such a social services program. In 2012, a 'No' response to a program variable (e.g., SFOOD12) means that such a social service program is not one of the four most important for that congregation. Appropriate recoding is necessary to assess change over time between 1998 and 2006-07 in response to these items. Care must be taken when assessing any change over time that includes 2012. Note that these variables are not mutually exclusive. A 1998 program described as 'feeding the homeless,' for example, is coded 1 on both SFOOD98 and SHOME98. Note also that these variables are coded at the congregation level, not at the program level. This means that, if a congregation is coded 1 on several of these variables, analysts will not be able to determine whether those codes refer to one program or to more than one program. Verbatim social service program descriptions may be requested via a restricted-data access agreement. This item was asked only if congregations reported social service programs (SOCLSERV=1 or SCLSERV2=1). If congregations do not have any social service programs (SOCLSERV=2 in 1998; SOCLSERV=2 and SCLSERV2=2 in 2006-07 and 2012), these variables were set at zero.

Verbatim responses to COLBUS98-NOCOLL06 were coded into a series of dichotomous variables, each indicating whether a collaborator of that type was mentioned. There are two versions of each dichotomous variable. Variables with the suffix '98' contain codes for programs mentioned in 1998. Variables with the suffix '06' contain codes for programs mentioned in 2006-07. Note that because each congregation could mention up to two collaborators per service program, these variables are not mutually exclusive. Note also that these variables are coded at the congregation-level and not the collaborator-level. Verbatim collaborator descriptions may be requested via a restricted-data access agreement. This item was asked only if congregations reported social service programs (SOCLSERV=1 or SCLSERV2=1). If a congregation reported no social service programs (SOCLSERV=2 in 1998 or SOCLSERV=2 and SCLSERV2=2 in 2006-07) these variables were set at zero. The question wording and coding of this item is identical in both survey waves, but the questions were asked of different subsamples of congregations (see the remark on SCLSERV2). Appropriate recoding is necessary to assess change over time in response to these items.

594) PRGCS_98
How much money, overall, did your congregation directly spend on all of these projects or programs within the past 12 months? Here, I'm asking about direct cash donations from your congregation, not counting staff time or volunteer time. Remarks: While details about social services programs (SABUSE98-SVDP06 and SABUSE12-SOTHER12) were limited to the top four programs in 2012, the follow-up questions about cost, staff, volunteers, and outside funds (PRGCS_98-GOVF2_12) were applicable to ALL social services programs. Thus, PRGCS and further social services follow-up variables for 2012 can be directly comparable to those for 2006-07. Although the same wording was used in all three survey waves, this item was asked of different subsamples of congregations in 1998 versus the later survey waves (see the remark on SCLSERV2). If including 1998, appropriate recoding is necessary to assess change over time in response to these items. To prevent confusion, we created different versions of PRGCS by survey wave. PRGCS_98, PRGCS_06, and PRGCS_12 contain data from 1998, 2006-07, and 2012, respectively. If a congregation reported no social service programs (SOCLSERV=2 in 1998), PRGCS_98 was set at zero.

Because the ACS samples a smaller proportion of the population than did the long-form census, the variability around the point estimates is likely greater. Analysts studying change over time should keep this in mind.
